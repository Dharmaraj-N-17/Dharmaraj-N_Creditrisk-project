Credit Risk Prediction with Explainable AI

This project builds a machine learning model to predict loan defaults using LightGBM. It handles class imbalance and evaluates performance with AUC, precision, and recall. SHAP and LIME techniques are applied to explain model decisions both globally and locally. The project compares SHAP and LIME for stability and interpretability. It identifies top risk factors like loan grade, income, and loan amount. The goal is to create an accurate, transparent, and fair credit risk model that supports trustworthy lending decisions.
